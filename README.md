**TechSpec AI: An Interactive 3GPP Technical Assistant**

**Overview:**
TechSpec AI is an AI-powered Q&A system designed to simplify the daunting task of sifting through extensive 3GPP technical specifications.
By leveraging retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), state-of-the-art vector search with FAISS, and cutting-edge language models, 
TechSpec AI enables telecom engineers and researchers to obtain precise, context-aware answers from complex documents in seconds.

**Features:**
1) _Intelligent Document Parsing:_ Automatically extracts text from multiple 3GPP specification PDFs using PyMuPDF.
2) _Efficient Semantic Search:_ Employs HuggingFace embeddings and FAISS indexing to break down large documents into manageable, searchable chunks.
3) _Context-Aware Q&A:_ Uses a retrieval-augmented generation approach to feed only the most relevant document segments to the language model.
4) _Scalable Architecture:_ Caches resource-intensive operations (PDF extraction and FAISS index creation) to ensure rapid query responses even when working with multiple documents.
5) _User-Friendly Interface:_ Built with Streamlit, the web UI offers an interactive platform for asking technical questions and receiving instant answers.
6) _Advanced Telecom Use Case:_ Specifically tailored to address the challenges of interpreting 3GPP TS/TR releases, significantly reducing manual lookup time for telecom R&D and compliance.


Run the Streamlit App:

**Interact with the Assistant:**
Enter a technical question in the provided input field.
The system retrieves the most relevant text chunks and uses a language model (Google Gemini) to generate a concise, accurate answer.
Answers are displayed in real time, dramatically reducing the time required for manual lookup.
